# Project 1: Road Tripcierge

## About this application

Our first group project is themed around travel and food (hotels as a backup). We plan to use two server side APIs which will take 
information given by the user and return appropriate options for the guidelines they have set out. 

We will establish a search bar or form for the user to input their desired options, and we will use a map API combined with a food 
(or hotel) by country API to showcase the options available to the user.

## User Story

As a user, I want a website where I can input my travel dates, and destination then have a list of hotels populated within the city of my choice and have the website provide directions to my specified hotel.
